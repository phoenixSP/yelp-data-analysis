1) How does a restaurant in one metropolitan area compare to the same business in another area (assuming they are a chain)?
	Step 1. Find chain restaurants by counting businesses with same name
		#Python Code
		import json
		import dicttoxml
		import sys

		def takeSecond(elem):
		    return elem[1]

		source_dataset_path = "../data/dataset_no_nulls/"
		file = "../business_same_name_count.txt"
		name_cnt = {}
		with open(source_dataset_path  +'business_no_nulls.json', "r") as ins:
		    for line in ins:
		        try:
		            json_obj = json.loads(line)
		            if "name" not in json_obj:
		                continue

		            name = json_obj["name"]
		            if name not in name_cnt:
		                name_cnt[name] = 0
		            name_cnt[name] = name_cnt[name] + 1
		        except ValueError:
		            print("err")

		bus_list = []
		for k, v in name_cnt.items():
		    bus_list.append((k, v))
		bus_list.sort(key=takeSecond, reverse=True)
		with open(file, "w") as out:
		    for bus in bus_list:
		        out.write(bus[0] + "," + str(bus[1]) + "\n")

	Step 2. for a given business, find average ratings per state
	#XQuery Code
	let  $business := /root/business

	let $bus_with_same_name :=(
		for $x in $business
		where $x/name="KFC"
		return $x
	)

	let $bus_xml := (
		let $xml:=(
		for $x in $bus_with_same_name
		return
			<business city="{$x/city}" state="{$x/state}"> {data($x/stars)} </business>)
		return
			<BB>
			{$xml}
			</BB>
	)

	let $avg_rating := avg(data($bus_xml/business))
	let $result :=(
		for $v in distinct-values($bus_xml/business/@state)
		return 
			<state name="{$v}"> {avg(data($bus_xml/business[@state=$v]))} </state>
		)

	return $result


2) Which users are considered more reliable reviewers?
3) Which users have more useful/fun/cool reviews (top 5%)?
4) Which businesses have higher/lower rating in terms of business category?
5) Which businesses have higher/lower rating in terms of business category ?
6) Which businesses have higher/lower rating in terms of business category ?
	ex: businesses with garage have higher rating than those with no garage
